# Onion-Architecture-Design


Im here in this project, trying to imitate my ECommerce demo project to absurb and test the tiny bit of the onion architecture.
Thereby learning the tackles and difficulties of the architecture and make provisions to prevent the hustles in the future. 

My goals are to:

Create new design patterns regarding to the obstacles that have been faced
Improve or reinvent the patterns for my project's sakes
